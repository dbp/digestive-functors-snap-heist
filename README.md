# Digestive functors snap backend to work with heist frontend

## State of this library, and why it exists
Explained in a lot more detail at https://github.com/dbp/digestive-functors-heist#readme , this backend exists to get around a problem with using digestive functors and wanting to access form input by names that are not generated by digestive-functors. Basically, instead of giving back a form element when asked for it, we just hand back the entire Params map. Then the frontend can pick the one it wants. This is NOT supposed to be the best solution, it is just necessary for now... Until we can specify the FormId in some other way.
